My name is Inna Mamedova, I am a student of Birmingham University Coding Bootcamp.
In this challenge I have created a Professional README.md Generator.

# Details
I have installed an Inquirer package.
I have used prompts to create necessary questions.
I have created a README file using writeToFile function.
In generateMarkdown file I gave the README desirable structure and data.
I have created a licence badge and made the badge clickable to direct the user to the opensource.org page where he can read more about the license.
I have created a function where nothing is displayed if the user doesn't want to add license to his project.
